# Module 13 Challenge

## Citi Bike NYC Bikesharing Analysis
---

### Project Overview
Last summer you and your friend, Kate took a 2 week trip to NYC and experienced how useful the bikesharing options were to tourists and New Yorkers alike. You start thinking about starting a bikesharking service in your hometown, Des Moines, IA. Kate finds a potential angel investor to provide seed money for your venture. You need to research how the bike share industry operates in New York, and then make a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines. The purpose for the project is to analyze and visualize the data in order to build convincing evidence that the new bike-sharing program is a solid business venture.

### Challenge Objectives
Continue to develop your analysis and visualizations by completing the following:
- Change the trip duration column of the dataset to a datetime format
- Create 5 specific visualizations to share in your pitch:
    - Line Graph: "Checkout Times for Users"
    - Line Graph: "Checkout Times by Gender"
    - Heatmap: "Trips by Weekday per Hour"
    - Heatmap: "Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)"
    - Heatmap: "User Trips by Gender by Weekday"
- Create a Tableau story and write a report for the investor presentation

## Summary
On a high-level summary, it can be said that most riders are male, most of the riders use a subscription and during the weekday, most of the usage occurs in the morning hours and late afternoon.  As for male to female usage and trip durations, it can be said that they are relatively the same, but due to the riders being mostly male, they stand out the most.  Also, most of the trips have a short duration of about 5-6 minutes.

- Two additional visualizations suggested for future analysis are:
    - Subscription comparison between Males and Females
    - Top 10 Stations where most trips start and/or end.
